## the view of the collaborator

1. import the bedtrack for your instrument - that is a track especially provided for you with a sync-tone-upfront and missing your instrument - e.g. a drum-bedtrack would never have a drum-groove on it!
2. duplicate the bedtrack track - remove the song so that you only got the sync-tone on this track! important => be sure that both tracks are positioned at point zero of your audio-project!!! => sync-tones are exactly at the same spot above each other!
3. record your instrument(s)
4. export your instrument with only: sync-tone track and instrument-track (each instrument with the sync-tone in one file! e.g. 3 guitar-tracks => you get 3 files each one guitar-track with the sync-tone together in one file each!

## the view of the mixer - importing the files with the sync-tones

* the mixer imports all tracks and ensures that the sync-tones of each track are aligned correctly in timing - if not the instruments are mostly not in sync because of different music-software and file-encodings!

## elementary for this topic
* don't copy any sync-tone in your instrument track upfront if you are not the first one uploading the first instrument - that would be the biggest fault ;-)
* what is the sync-tone for? => the one who starts the collaboration adds a tone or some clicks which can be recognized by the mixer in volume peaks and tone - it's like counting in 1,2,3,4 - this of course can be different in every track and the really important thing: every music format or music programms can have minimal milliseconds upfront or on the back of the track which are added to the file and the music you put together is out of sync!! I usually get the files of my favorite drummer and they are always shifted some milliseconds to the right - but because he leaves the sync-tone of my bedtrack and just cuts the rest of my track from his music software on export he export MY SYNC-TONE with HIS INSTRUMENT - and that's the trick => you got the correct positioning of his instrument in relative view of the position of my sync-tone to the track used!
